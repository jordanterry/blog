# My Blog

This repo contains the Jekyll source of my blog. Found at jordanterry.co.uk.

I used to run my blog from a Wordpress installation. I realised it wasn't worth the cost of my expensive hosting. I
decided to move to host a static site on Github hosting.

## How to build

This blog is managed using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) specifically Jekyll that works
with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/versions/). To run it
use the following:

```shell
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
