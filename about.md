 <br />

I'm Jordan, a Software Developer working at <a href="https://etsy.com/" target="_blank">Etsy</a>. I work in the Search and Android domains. I specialise in a number of areas: Gradle, Kotlin, Android, Testing and Strong Typing. 


After ten years in London, my wife and I have moved to Brooklyn, New York. I am a lover of aviation, mountains, long-distance challenges and Pasta.
