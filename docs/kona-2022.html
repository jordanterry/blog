        <p>About three years ago I signed up for a triathlon. Five months after that I managed to drag my way around that triathlon and kind of enjoy it.. little did I know how much of an impact this would have on my life!</p>

<p>After that first race (super sprint distance) I discovered there was a huge world of triathlon out there. One of the first things I stumbled upon was the Ironman World Championships in Kona.</p>

<p>For those who don’t know the Ironman World Championships are held every October in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii. Some of the best triathletes of the year gather on the island a race each other over the 3.9km swim, 180km bike ride and 42km run.</p>

<p>What a bunch of nutters.</p>

<p>Anyway, I’d like to go there and do that in 2022. You can’t just rock up to a world championship event you have to qualify for it. To qualify for it you have to be one of the best athletes at an Ironman event, like top-5 in your age group good.</p>

<p>I’m nothing in the shape I need to be to hit this goal right now. So I need to really apply myself for two years and hopefully I will find myself swimming with turtles in 2022. I’ve been telling people this for quite a while now but now its time to turn my threats of getting good at sports into some form of reality.</p>

<p>To stand a chance of seeing those turtles, 2021 will have to be a big year for me. I have a few goals I have set myself. I need to train consistently, on 31st December 2021 I want to look back on my Training Peaks and see 52 weeks of perfectly completed sessions. Of course illness and life may get in the way so I want to perfectly complete more than 95% of the training sessions I am given.</p>

<p>If we are lucky enough to race I have two A-races; Ironman 70.3 Marbella which I want to complete in less than 5 hours and Ironman Switzerland which I want to complete in less than 11 hours.</p>

<p>I’m also going to keep a training diary on this blog. Reflection is one of the best ways to improve yourself and a training diary helps you to really understand how you are feeling. Why not share it with the one or two people who might read this website?</p>

<p>Those are some pretty hefty goals, but if I train, eat and sleep well I see absolutely no reason why I shouldn’t hit them.</p>

<p>My new season of training kicks off on the 26th October.. wish me luck.</p>
