<p>A good chunk of my last eight hours in the air have been spent flying around the circuit and I have finally gained enough solo time that my instructor has the confidence to send me up on my own; from start to end.</p>

<h2 id="agenda-for-today">Agenda for today</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Practice short field landings</li>
  <li>Practice glide approaches</li>
  <li>Land on the centre of the runway </li>
</ul>

<p>In the past I have been up with my instructor and he has done a few circuits with me and he has then jumped out and let me do my solos. Today was different as I did my walk around and jumped in the plane all on my own. I started up the plane as normal and began taxiing, this is where I was struck by how weak nervous I sounded on the radio, and that in turn made me actually feel nervous as I was taxiing. I took my time running through my power checks and allowed myself to get my head straight. When I was ready I headed out onto the runway.</p>

<p>As I took off my nerves disappeared and I felt comfortable. I knew what I was doing up in the air; even if I am on my own. I settled in for a good forty-five minutes of flight.</p>

<p>Not much exciting happened during the flight, which was a good thing! I did get to practice short field landings as I hoped and I was able to stop on the runway in less than 400 metres every time.</p>

<p>I don’t feel like I managed to improve the accuracy of my landings and had to correct my position on the runway with some aggressive ruddering. I think my problem here comes from not making enough corrections on the final leg. In the future I will attempt to make some corrections whilst on the base leg and see what happens!</p>

<p>I practiced a few more glide approaches but I haven’t quite worked out the best place to cut the throttle yet.</p>

<p>Other than above I don’t have too much to report other than I made it through my first entire solo trip. I didn’t run into any issues whilst starting up and taxiing. My nervous voice eventually disappeared and was replaced by my best confident pilots voice. It was a great hurdle to get past and I am excited for my first solo trip outside of the circuit.</p>

  <li>Practice glide approaches</li>
