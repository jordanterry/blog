    Code just got cheap. Really cheap. Maybe it's time to dust off those old software engineering books.

There is no getting around it, we can bury our heads in the sand, but Claude Code can do a fair chunk of the job for us Software Developers. It can churn out code at astonishing rates. But what if we thought of this as a good thing, what if writing less code ourselves allows us to return to the roots of our profession?

Two books I read during university, and a few times since, come to mind: The Mythical Man Month and the Pragmatic Programmer. The books about programming aren't... actually about programming. They broadly describe the Software Development Lifecycle that surrounds producing an "artefact". They are books that describe how to talk to stakeholders, and how to write manuals and define requirements. Some of us may even have the displeasure of having written documents defining functional requirements:

> F1. Allow user to make a search from the home screen
>
> F1.1 When the user taps the search bar opens the search interstitial
>
> F1.2 yawn, these were so boring, even more annoying when QA told us our implementation was wrong

But why did we do all of this? Well, code was expensive! A lot of concepts in those books come from a time before Continuous Integration and Deployment. It took time to compile and then debug code. A mistake could be costly.

Software Development has made a shift left since the days of working on IBM mainframes. Code has become cheap, meaning we reach to code first, rather than defining requirements. We don't write the great technical documents of yesteryear. I mean, we aren't designing file systems after all. Some of the techniques are described as old now, replaced by agile and iterative development.

We in the fast paced world of tech and e-commerce might turn our nose up at the idea of waterfall. We hate the idea of enterprise-y lists of requirements that are a bore to read. These were painful when code was expensive, and then slightly cheaper. But, code just became even cheaper than before, like really cheap. But.. tools like Claude Code aren't mind readers, we have to explicitly define our requirements up front for it to work.

It might be time to blow off the dust of the books written by the elders of our trade and try out some of their time tested ideas.
