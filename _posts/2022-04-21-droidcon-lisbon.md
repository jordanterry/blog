I spoke at Droidcon Lisbon about a topic I called "Modular Indirection". This is a term I gave to the concept of using the `:api` and `:implementation` patterns shared in [Android at Scale @ Square](https://www.droidcon.com/2019/11/15/android-at-scale-square/). I had recently moved to Twitter where we made extensive use of this pattern. I was eager to share my thoughts on the topic! 

In hindight, this is a dry topic and a tough one to tackle as your first talk! I still had fun, and enjoyed the experience of traveling abroad to give the talk! 

A few years later, as I put this together, I was suprised to find my talk top the [list of memorable talks on this website](https://speednetsoftware.com/droidcon-speednet/).
