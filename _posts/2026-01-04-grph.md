I'm curious about how agentic tools can better understand a codebase if they know how to traverse a Graph.

For that reason, I (read Claude Code) have put together a CLI tool to easily consume a Graph. I call it [`grph`](https://github.com/jordanterry/grph).

## How does this work?

The CLI is a thin wrapper around the Python library [NetworkX](https://networkx.org). The codebase exposes a number of features.

The CLI ingests a graph formatted with GEXF format. This is a universal way of defining a graph.

### Neighbours

Imagine you have an airline route network. You're at Gatwick and want to know where you can fly direct:

```
$ grph neighbors routes.gexf Gatwick

Neighbors of Gatwick (depth=1, direction=all)

┌───────────┬─────────────┐
│ ID        │ Label       │
├───────────┼─────────────┤
│ Barcelona │ Barcelona   │
│ Amsterdam │ Amsterdam   │
│ Nice      │ Nice        │
│ Berlin    │ Berlin      │
│ Lisbon    │ Lisbon      │
└───────────┴─────────────┘
```

What about with one layover?

```
$ grph neighbors routes.gexf Gatwick --depth 2
```

### Shortest Path

How do I get from Edinburgh to Dubrovnik with the fewest connections?

```
$ grph path routes.gexf Edinburgh Dubrovnik

Path found (length: 3)
Edinburgh → Gatwick → Split → Dubrovnik
```

Or find all the options:

```
$ grph all-paths routes.gexf Edinburgh Dubrovnik --max-depth 4
```

### PageRank

Which airports are the most critical hubs in the network? PageRank reveals where traffic flows through:

```
$ grph centrality routes.gexf --type pagerank --top 5

┌───────────┬───────────┐
│ Node      │ Score     │
├───────────┼───────────┤
│ Gatwick   │ 0.0892    │
│ Barcelona │ 0.0734    │
│ Amsterdam │ 0.0651    │
│ Milan     │ 0.0612    │
│ Paris     │ 0.0598    │
└───────────┴───────────┘
```

### And more

**Find isolated route clusters** - are there parts of the network disconnected from each other?

```
$ grph components routes.gexf --list
```

**Blast radius** - if Gatwick closes, which destinations become unreachable from Edinburgh?

```
$ grph reachable routes.gexf Edinburgh
```

**Extract a subgraph** - pull out just the UK airports for focused analysis:

```
$ grph subgraph routes.gexf --nodes Gatwick,Edinburgh,Manchester,Bristol --output uk-routes.gexf
```

## But why?

I work in a medium-sized Android codebase. It has a lot of complexity baked into it: modularisation and a complex DI graph. I want Claude Code to be able to browse and understand both static and dynamic connections.

The same queries that answer "how do I fly from Edinburgh to Dubrovnik?" can answer "how does `MainActivity` depend on `DatabaseHelper`?" - it's all just graph traversal.
