I've been sitting on some improvements to a previous talk I have given by the same name. This presentation seeked to improve upon it. I've added an introduction to build systems and how they work, this provides a nice introduction into the world of Application Binary Interfaces. 

This was a special event for me as I traveled to it with work, I was able to meet some CDMX based colleagues in person. Note to remember, Mexico City is very high!
