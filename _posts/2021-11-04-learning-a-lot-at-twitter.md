I recently joined Twitter as an Android Developer. So far, it is unlike anywhere I have ever worked before. In two months I have learned a lot and have been incredibly overwhelmed. I’ve recently felt like I have started to get on top of the learning curve and I can start to reflect a bit on the first two months. To do that, I’m going to make an effort to blog three times a week focusing on a few topics.

I already have so many thoughts on MVI, dependency injection (and annotation processors!), lifecycles and memory leaks, build times, working with developers across the pond, finally learning how to rebase, saying phab instead of pull request, senior developers and not knowing everything about the app you work on. Have I mentioned build times?
