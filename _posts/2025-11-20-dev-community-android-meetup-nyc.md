An opportunity to talk at a naecent meetup group presented itself! I had recently given the talke "Reusable Modules: It's as easy as ABI" in Mexico and thought it would be great to go again. I wasn't able to make the improvements I wished to, due to illness and other work commitments. Regardless, it was a great night!
