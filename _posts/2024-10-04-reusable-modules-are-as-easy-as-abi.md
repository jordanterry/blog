excerpt: |
    A brief summary of a lightning talk I gave at Kotlin London on October 10th 2024.
    I delve into how we can create reusable modules. We look at how visibility modifiers such as `public` and `private` work with Gradle dependency declerations to impact a modules Application Binary Interface.

I recently gave a lighning talk at [Kotlin London](https://www.meetup.com/kotlin-london/). This is a Kotlin that was
hosted at the Marks & Spencer offices (I work there!). Kotlin London is a great event, please come along!

I gave a talk aimed at helping other developers think about reusable modules. I aimed to give some context about
Kotlin & Gradle and then tie it together on the topic of ABIs.
